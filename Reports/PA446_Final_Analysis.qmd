## 1. Introduction

Arts education plays a critical role in supporting students’ academic achievement, social, emotional development, and long-term civic engagement. Despite its importance, access to high-quality arts programming in Chicago Public Schools (CPS) varies substantially across neighborhoods, raising persistent concerns about educational equity.

To evaluate arts education environments and program quality, CPS operates the Creative Schools Certification (CSC) system, which categorizes schools into four levels: Emerging, Developing, Strong, and Excelling. While CSC provides a useful benchmark for school-level arts access, there has been limited analysis of how these scores relate to broader socioeconomic conditions across ZIP codes, and which communities may be structurally disadvantaged in receiving robust arts education.

This project examines **how neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors, such as poverty rate, racial composition, linguistic diversity, and educational attainment, are associated with CSC outcomes across Chicago ZIP codes**. Using spatial visualization, the analysis identifies geographic patterns of inequality, and applies a decision tree classifier to explore which factors most strongly differentiate high- and low-scoring areas.

The goal of this study is to provide a data-driven understanding of inequities in arts education across Chicago, and to offer empirical insights for identifying which neighborhoods require targeted support, as well as potential policy strategies to advance arts education equity citywide.

## 2. Data Acquisition

This analysis draws on two primary data sources to examine the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and arts education access across Chicago.

First, we obtained ZIP Code-level indicators from the **American Community Survey (ACS) 2022 5-year estimates** using the API. Key variables included:

-   Poverty rate

-   Percent White (used to derive percent non-White)

-   Percent English-only households (used to derive percent non-English-speaking)

-   Percent of residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher (used to derive percent non-college)

Second, we used the **Creative Schools Certification (CSC)** dataset provided through **Ingenuity’s ArtLook Maps**, a platform that documents CPS arts education resources, programs, and partnerships. ZIP codes were extracted from school address fields, and CSC levels (Emerging, Developing, Strong, Excelling) were converted into a numeric scale ranging from 1 to 4 to enable quantitative analysis.

Finally, the ACS and ArtLook datasets were merged by ZIP code to create a unified dataset linking neighborhood socioeconomic conditions with arts education outcomes across Chicago.
